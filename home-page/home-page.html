      <h3>How to use</h3>
      <p> 
        To use the tool, export a html file from FM using the <a href="../assets/" download="views">views</a> linked which are views which will show all the 
        attributes for the players. This includes views for your squad, player search and shortlist</br>
        Once you have exported a html file you can upload it here. It will ask you to save the output, save this as a html file. </br> 
        It will give you a file that is in a table format of all the players and allow you to sort each column easily
